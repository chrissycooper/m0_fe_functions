# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
Well, yesterday I didnt spend my time well and I ended up working pretty late. I did things out of order and I was doing a fair amount of task switching. So today I followed my initial plan from Monday a little bit better, and so far it's working pretty well. I find that I work better and faster if I let myself take little breaks instead of trying to force myself through something. Today those little breaks have looked like: staring out the window, standing outside for a bit, getting coffee refilled, simply getting up and standing, and taking a few deep breaths when I notice myself feeling particularly tired or fuzzy brained. As long as those breaks are contained and don't last too long, it's been helpful.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function is like a list of directions and tools that help you do something. Like when its time to brush your teeth, you can look at the steps and each time you know what to do because you have the steps kept together. You keep your toothbrush and your toothpaste next to each other because you use them both each time you brush your teeth. 

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Arguments are the specific data that gets entered into the function when you're ready to call it. The parameters are like labeled envelopes that are empty and waiting for your arguments. And the parameters are set up when you set up the function itself. 

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
I'm still a little curious about where or how the program holds the values it returns. Maybe there isn't a good answer for that.
